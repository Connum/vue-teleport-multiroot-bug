<template>
    <p>I am a teleported component with multiple root elements</p>
    <p>This is the only difference between the component above and this one... Try removing (not commenting out!) this second paragraph from MultiRootBlock.vue and it will work!</p>

<style scoped>
    p {
        color: red;
    }
</style>
